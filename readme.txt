== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. Do I heave to close the [div] shortcode? =
The closing ([/div]) shortcode is optional. However note that you will have
only the embed attribute to enter contents if you don't close the shortcode
manually.

= 2. Does [div] shortcode allow code injection? =
No. All content from \"class\" and \"embed\" parameters is sanitized and quotes
are substituted by the corresponding HTML entities.

= 3. May the user create a CSS style different from those on the stylesheet? =
No. Diver Wordpress plugin is intended to respect theme styles and be away from
direct style definitions. Style definition and content shouldn\'t be mixed up,
should them?
